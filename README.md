i don't find that proggeram any where 
but you can use it and this is guide

first you need to install the packages
there is only 1 package -selenium-
```python
pip install selenium
```
OK when installing is ended you need to run the progeram 
you can see 11 TXT files in the 
one of them is the full list of codes 0001 to  9999 named wordlist.txt
and the others named wordlist1.txt to wordlist10.txt 
i partition the big 10000 line one to 10 1000 line file 
you can run 10 progeram Simultaneously and get the result 10 times faster
but if you cant extract the sub link of site and run 10 time you can run 
one time but using one time takes like five and half hour

ok lets continue
first you need send the URL
NEXT you send the CSS selector off phone input 
second you give target number
thred you give the submit button selector (its not nessery it searchs Automaticly)
next you send the CSS selector off OTP input
and the submit button selector (again its not nessery it searchs Automaticly)
and then you enter the ful file name like wordlist.txt
and it starts brutforcing
done!!
